# Ion

A [voice user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_user_interface) that enables you to talk with a [Nano Bot](https://spec.nbots.io), aiming to create a [conversational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface) experience.

It provides a modern alternative to traditional [virtual assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant). It's highly **customizable**, leveraging [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai); **powerful**, backed by [Nano Bots](https://spec.nbots.io), which are compatible with providers such as [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini); and **hackable**, offering support for [Nano Apps](https://github.com/gbaptista/nano-apps) that can be coded in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html), [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org), or [Clojure](https://clojure.org).

## Setup

### Services

To use Nano Bots with [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), you'll need an API Key, which you can obtain from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com). It is a paid service for which you are [charged based on consumption](https://openai.com/pricing).

If you're planning to use Nano Bots with [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini), check [here](https://github.com/gbaptista/gemini-ai#credentials) to learn how to obtain your credentials. It's also a paid service.

Obtain an Access Key for [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai) by registering at the [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/). It's _Forever-Free_ for _"individuals exploring, experimenting, and evaluating"_, and [paid for other use cases](https://picovoice.ai/pricing/).

### Installation

To enable speech and sound cues, you need to be able to play audio files, which requires the installation of [mpv](https://mpv.io):

```sh
sudo pacman -S mpv # Arch / Manjaro
sudo apt-get install mpv # Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS
sudo dnf install mpv # Fedora / CentOS / RHEL
```

Clone the necessary repositories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gbaptista/ion.git

cd ion

git clone https://github.com/gbaptista/ion-assets.git assets
```

Get the necessary keys from the [Requirements](#services) section and set up your `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the content of the `.env` file to add your keys, example:
```sh
PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY=your-key

OPENAI_API_ADDRESS=https://api.openai.com
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-access-token

NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=UNSAFE
NANO_BOTS_END_USER=your-user
```

Alternatively, you can export the environment variables on your system:
```sh
export PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY=your-key

export OPENAI_API_ADDRESS=https://api.openai.com
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-access-token

export NANO_BOTS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=UNSAFE
export NANO_BOTS_END_USER=your-user
```

Install [Babashka](https://babashka.org):

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/install | sudo bash
```

You need to have [Ruby 3](https://www.ruby-lang.org) (with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org)) and [Python 3](https://www.python.org) (with [PyPI](https://pypi.org)) installed on your system.

Install Ruby and Bundler:
```sh
sudo pacman -S ruby # Arch / Manjaro
sudo apt-get install ruby-full # Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS
sudo dnf install ruby # Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

sudo gem install bundler
```

Install and set up the [Nano Bots CLI](https://github.com/icebaker/ruby-nano-bots):
```sh
sudo gem install nano-bots
```

Install Ruby dependencies:
```sh
sudo bundle install
```

Install Python dependencies:
> If you are running a Raspberry Pi, check its [specific additional instructions](#raspberry-pi).
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Start by ensuring that your Nano Bot is operating correctly by testing it through the REPL:

```sh
nb static/cartridges/default.yml - repl
```

```text
ü§ñ> Hi!

Hello! How can I assist you today?

ü§ñ> What time is it?

date-and-time {}
{:date-time 2023-12-08T07:42:54-03:00, :timezone America/Sao_Paulo}

Right now it's 7:42 a.m.

ü§ñ> |
```

You can exit the REPL by typing `exit`.

With Nano Bots properly working, start Ion:

```sh
./ion.sh static/personas/default.yml
```

You can use the [wake word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_spotting) `Jarvis` to speak and interact:

```text
> üêç Monitor Engine started.
> üëã Welcome to Ion!
> üéß Listening and waiting for a wake word.
> üéôÔ∏è Awake and recording your speech.
> üé∂ Audio successfully recorded.
> üíæ Recorded audio temporarily saved to disk.
> üíé Interaction Engine started.
> ‚úçÔ∏è Converting speech to text.
> üìù Speech converted to text: What time is it?
> üõ†Ô∏è Nano Bot is executing a tool: date-and-time {}
> üì¶ Nano Bot received a response from a tool: date-and-time {} {:date-time 2023-12-09T17...
> üìú Nano Bot answer received: The current time is 17:34, or 5:34 PM.
> üîä Starting to speak: The current time is 17:34, or 5:34 PM.
> ‚ú® Interaction completed.
> üéôÔ∏è Recording a possible follow-up.
> üé∂ Audio successfully recorded.
> üï≥Ô∏è No follow-up detected.
```

Remember that some [Nano Apps](https://github.com/gbaptista/nano-apps) may have their own dependencies, so check if you have them installed for proper functioning.

## Personas

A _persona_ YAML file contains human-readable data that defines how the voice will sound, custom configurations for service providers, voice engine tweaks, logs, events, and audio cues, as well as the path for a Nano Bot [_cartridge_](https://github.com/gbaptista/ion/blob/main/static/cartridges/default.yml) that defines goals, expected behaviors, tools (functions), and settings for authentication and provider utilization.

The default persona is available at [`static/personas/default.yml`](https://github.com/gbaptista/ion/blob/main/static/personas/default.yml). Feel free to modify it or create a new one.

### Voice Engine

#### Tweaking

You can tweak settings to have a better experience for your specific scenario, setup, environment, and hardware:

```yaml
---
voice-engine:
  settings:
    maximum-recording-duration:
      seconds: 30
    duration-of-silence-to-stop-recording:
      seconds: 2
    minimum-recording-duration-to-be-a-valid-input:
      seconds: 3
    voice-probability-threshold: 0.5
```

#### Custom Wake Words

[Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai), by default, support the following [wake words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_spotting):

```text
alexa, americano, blueberry, bumblebee, computer,
grapefruit, grasshopper, hey barista, hey google,
hey siri, jarvis, ok google, pico clock, picovoice,
porcupine, smart mirror, snowboy, terminator, view glass
```

You can use multiple wake words if you want:
```yaml
---
voice-engine:
  provider:
    settings:
      porcupine:
        keywords:
          - jarvis
          - alexa
        sensitivities:
          - 0.5
          - 0.5
```

You can also create a custom wake word [through their platform](https://picovoice.ai/blog/console-tutorial-custom-wake-word/).

### Speech to Text

The current Speech to Text support is provided by OpenAI's [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper):
```yaml
---
speech-to-text:
  provider:
    id: openai
    credentials:
      address: ENV/OPENAI_API_ADDRESS
      access-token: ENV/OPENAI_API_KEY
    settings:
      model: whisper-1
```

### Text to Speech

#### Fragment Speech

Enables the system to perform text-to-speech on partially received content. As answers are generated through streaming, it tries to infer optimal points where we have enough text to create speech and gradually create new speeches to be played. This improves speed, as we don't need to wait for the entire answer from Nano Bot to be provided before starting the text-to-speech process.

```yaml
---
text-to-speech:
  settings:
    fragment-speech: true
```

#### Providers

You can use one of the three supported text-to-speech providers: OpenAI, AWS, or Google.

##### OpenAI Text to Speech

```yaml
---
text-to-speech:
  provider:
    id: openai
    credentials:
      address: ENV/OPENAI_API_ADDRESS
      access-token: ENV/OPENAI_API_KEY
    settings:
      model: tts-1
      voice: onyx
```

Examples of possible voices:
```text
alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
```

For high-quality audio, you can use `model: tts-1-hd`, though it is slower and [more expensive](https://openai.com/pricing).

OpenAI's text-to-speech is language-agnostic; it can speak multiple languages.

Check all the available voices in the [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options).

##### AWS Amazon Polly

```yaml
---
text-to-speech:
  provider:
    id: aws
    credentials:
      access-key: ENV/AWS_ACCESS_KEY
      secret-key: ENV/AWS_SECRET_KEY
      region: ENV/AWS_REGION
    settings:
      voice_id: Danielle
      engine: neural
```

Examples of possible Brazillian Portuguese voices:
```text
Camila, Vitoria, Thiago
```

Examples of possible American English voices:
```text
Danielle, Matthew, Gregory, Joanna, Kendra, Kimberly, Salli, Joey, Ruth, Stephen
```

Check all the available voices in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html).

You need to add your AWS credentials to your [environment](#installation).

Note that Polly voices are designed for specific languages (e.g., `pt-BR`, `en-US`), and you need to correctly match the `voice_id` with the type of voice `engine` (`neural` or `standard`).

Be aware of [the costs](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/), as `neural` and `standard` voices are priced differently.

##### Google Text to Speech

```yaml
---
text-to-speech:
  provider:
    id: google
    credentials:
      service: cloud-text-to-speech-api
      file-path: ENV/GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH
    settings:
      name: pt-BR-Neural2-A
      ssml_gender: FEMALE
      language_code: pt-BR
```

Alternatively, if you are using [_Application Default Credentials_](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials), you can omit the `file-path`:

```yaml
---
text-to-speech:
  provider:
    id: google
    credentials:
      service: cloud-text-to-speech-api
    settings:
      name: pt-BR-Neural2-A
      ssml_gender: FEMALE
      language_code: pt-BR
```

Examples of possible Brazillian Portuguese voices:
```text
pt-BR | FEMALE:
pt-BR-Neural2-A, pt-BR-Neural2-C, pt-BR-Wavenet-A, pt-BR-Wavenet-C

pt-BR | MALE:
pt-BR-Neural2-B, pt-BR-Wavenet-B
```

Examples of possible American English voices:
```text
en-US | FEMALE:
en-US-Neural2-C, en-US-Neural2-E, en-US-Neural2-F, en-US-Neural2-G, en-US-Neural2-H,
en-US-News-K, en-US-News-L, en-US-Studio-O, en-US-Wavenet-C, en-US-Wavenet-E,
en-US-Wavenet-F, en-US-Wavenet-G, en-US-Wavenet-H

en-US | MALE:
en-US-Neural2-A, en-US-Neural2-D, en-US-Neural2-I, en-US-Neural2-J, en-US-News-N,
en-US-Studio-Q, en-US-Wavenet-A, en-US-Wavenet-B, en-US-Wavenet-D, en-US-Wavenet-I,
en-US-Wavenet-J
```

Check all the available voices in the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices).

You may need to add the path to your `google-credentials.json` file to your [environment](#installation).

Note that Google voices are designed for specific languages (e.g., `pt-BR`, `en-US`), and you need to correctly match the `name` with the `ssml_gender` and `language_code`.

Be aware of [the costs](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/pricing), as _Neural_, _Studio_, and _WaveNet_ voices are priced differently.

Google offers a preview of [_Polyglot Voices_](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/polyglot), which can speak multiple languages.

## Events

### Flow of Events

Ion operation is based on a flow of events. To understand this flow and all the associated events, you can inspect the following flow chart:

[![Ion Events Flow Chart, accessible description above.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbaptista/assets/main/ion/events-flow.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbaptista/assets/main/ion/events-flow.jpg)
> [_click to view in a larger size_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbaptista/assets/main/ion/events-flow.jpg)

Accessible description of all possible events:

**Monitor Engine:**

```text
> monitor-engine-started
  > welcome-message-booted
  > listening-and-waiting
    > awake-and-recording
    > recording-follow-up
    > audio-recorded
      > audio-discarded
      > no-follow-up-received
      > audio-stored

> interaction-interrupted
```

**Interaction Engine:**

```text
> interaction-engine-started
  > speech-to-text-started
    > speech-to-text-completed
      > nano-bot-tool-confirming
      > nano-bot-tool-executing
      > nano-bot-tool-responding
      > nano-bot-answer-received
        > speaking-started
          > interaction-completed

> interruption-requested
```

**Other Events:**

```
> error-raised
```

### Customizing Events

Each of the [21 possible distinct events](#flow-of-events) that can be dispatched during the operation of Ion, can be individually customizable with symbols (Unicode emojis), audio cues, volume, and messages.

Which events should have audio cues, at what volume, etc., will be a personal decision based on the experience that you are trying to create for your [_persona_](#personas). Here's how you can customize an event:

```yaml
event:
  listening-and-waiting:
    symbol: üéß
    message: Listening and waiting for a wake word.
    audio: assets/audio/clue.wav
    volume: 1
```

Symbols (Unicode emojis) and messages are used in the logs of Ion. Audio and volume settings are used for playing audio files, which can be in WAV, OGG, or MP3 formats.

#### Normalizing Volumes

You can adjust the individual volumes for each event to normalize the varying levels of audio. The recommendation is to not have volumes above 1.0, as this may create distortion in the audio on some speakers. Ideally, set your highest volume at or below 1.0, and reduce the others accordingly to maintain balance.

#### Special Events

The `welcome-message-booted` can be used to play a welcome message using text-to-speech:

```yaml
---
events:
  welcome-message-booted:
    symbol: üëã
    message: Welcome to Ion!
    speak: true
    volume: 1
```

The `speaking-started` event can be used to set the volume of the text-to-speech answer audios:

```yaml
---
events:
  speaking-started:
    symbol: üîä
    message: 'Starting to speak:'
    volume: 0.8
```

## Hardware

Ion performs well using simple headphones and a microphone. For open environments, you may want to consider investing in speakers that will provide the audio experience you are seeking and, specifically, a microphone appropriate for open spaces, such as an omnidirectional one or those designed for conference rooms.

### Raspberry Pi

Before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you need to create a Python virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Check out [Python on Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#python-on-raspberry-pi).

To display Unicode emojis in console terminals on a Raspberry Pi, you need to install a font that supports Unicode emojis:

```sh
sudo apt-get install fonts-noto-color-emoji
```

You need to restart the Raspberry Pi to see the results.

### Known Pitfalls

If you connect a speaker to your computer using a jack plug, you might experience issues with audio inactivity which can lead to hearing "static noise." On Linux, you can fix this by:

```sh
/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
options snd_hda_intel power_save=0 power_save_controller=N


/etc/pulse/daemon.conf
exit-idle-time = -1
```

## Development

### Updating the README

Update the `template.md` file and then:

```sh
bb tasks/generate-readme.clj
```

Trick for automatically updating the `README.md` when `template.md` changes:

```sh
sudo pacman -S inotify-tools # Arch / Manjaro
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools # Debian / Ubuntu / Raspberry Pi OS
sudo dnf install inotify-tools # Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

while inotifywait -e modify template.md; do bb tasks/generate-readme.clj; done
```

Trick for Markdown Live Preview:
```sh
pip install -U markdown_live_preview

mlp README.md -p 8076
```

## Accessibility

We are committed to making Ion accessible. If you face any accessibility issues or have recommendations for improvement, please feel free to fill out an [issue](https://github.com/gbaptista/ion/issues)!

## Version

`1.0.0`

## Acknowledgments

I have been trying (and failing) to build this for over a decade, and we finally have all the core pieces of the puzzle to make it possible at the level I envisioned:

- Voice User Interface
    - Speech-to-Text
    - Text-to-Speech
    - Keyword Spotting
- Conversational User Interface
    - Large Language Models
    - Function Calling
- Hardware
    - IoT

These six ingredients make the magic happen, and beyond this point, it's all about continuing to improve the underlying technology and build on top of it. The puzzle for the first chapter has been solved, and although this is probably just an early glimpse of what the future holds for us, I'm thrilled about the possibilities.

That being said, over the years of my attempts, I want to acknowledge three main projects that along the way gave me hope for the future:

- [Mycroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycroft_(software))
- [Mozilla Common Voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Voice)
- [Amazon Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa)
